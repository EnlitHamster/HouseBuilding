## Core knowledge

Basing the terms used on the military accountability system, we find that the basic equation that allows such systems to exist is the following:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\left(\begin{array}{c}policies\end{array}\right)&space;\cdot&space;\left(\begin{array}{c}reports\end{array}\right)&space;=&space;strategy" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left(\begin{array}{c}policies\end{array}\right)&space;\cdot&space;\left(\begin{array}{c}reports\end{array}\right)&space;=&space;strategy" title="\left(\begin{array}{c}policies\end{array}\right) \cdot \left(\begin{array}{c}reports\end{array}\right) = strategy"/></a>

Where <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\left(\begin{array}{c}policies\end{array}\right)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left(\begin{array}{c}policies\end{array}\right)" title="\left(\begin{array}{c}policies\end{array}\right)"/></a> is the set of adopted policies by the system, <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\left(\begin{array}{c}reports\end{array}\right)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\left(\begin{array}{c}reports\end{array}\right)" title="\left(\begin{array}{c}reports\end{array}\right)"/></a> is the set of reports generated by the subsystems that account to the system and <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=strategy" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?strategy" title="strategy"/></a> is the result, namely the set of results of the application of the policies with input the information contained in the reports; in other terms, the plan that the system "chooses" to respond to a situation.

In this equation lies the basis from which accountability arises. Specifically, a subsystem generates its own report from its own data and the reports from its own subsystems, generating a new report. Said report is, in other words, the strategy the subsystem will apply to its own subsystems with its own decisions. This subsystem is thus accountable whereas this system upholds its own policies and answers of its own decisions to the system, being able to show the decision-making process that leads towards the final strategy. Furthermore, to uphold said accountability, the subsystem is required to recuse itself whenever it is unable to enforce its strategy.
